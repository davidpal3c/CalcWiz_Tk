## Guiding Principles

- Modularity: Divide your code into separate modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the program.
- Readability: Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable and function names. Use comments to explain complex parts of the code.
- Reusability: Design functions to be reusable across different parts of the program. Consider making your functions generic and flexible.
- Separation of Concerns: Each module should have a specific responsibility and not overlap with others. This allows for easier maintenance and debugging.
- Error Handling: Implement error handling to deal with user input errors, file read/write issues, etc. Provide informative error messages.



## Progressive development schema 

Step 1: Refactor Existing Structure

    Refactor Main Script (calculator.py):
        Ensure it handles only command-line arguments and basic user input.
        Call functions from the user_interface.py for user interaction.

    Refactor Data Handling (data_handler.py):
        Continue managing input and output of numerical values.
        Ensure it remains focused on data-related operations.

    Refactor Calculator Operations (calculator_operations.py):
        Split it into two parts:
            Basic operations (existing functions).
            Placeholder for advanced operations (to be developed later).

    Refactor File I/O (file_io.py):
        Continue managing file read/write operations.
        Keep using libraries like pandas for efficiency.

    Refactor User Interface (user_interface.py):
        Handle user input/output through the command line.
        Call functions from other modules based on user input.

Step 2: Introduce GUI

    Introduce GUI Module (gui.py):
        Create a module to interact with Tkinter.
        Implement functions to display GUI elements for input and output.
        Use event handling to connect GUI elements with backend functions.

    Extend GUI for Save to File:
        Extend the GUI module to include options for saving results to files.
        Utilize the file_io module for file-related functionalities.

Step 3: Advanced Calculator Operations

    Expand Calculator Operations (calculator_operations.py):
        Implement advanced operations on lists, tuples, and hash tables.
        Consider sorting, filtering, and searching functionalities.

Step 4: History and Memory

    Implement History and Memory Feature:
        Create a module (e.g., history.py) for storing and displaying a history of calculations.
        Allow users to recall and reuse previous results in new calculations.

Step 5: Unit Testing and Error Handling

    Introduce Unit Testing:
        Use unittest or pytest to test functions in each module.
        Create test cases for both existing and new features.

    Improve Error Handling:
        Enhance error handling throughout the codebase.
        Provide more informative error messages to the user.
        Consider logging errors for future reference.

Step 6: Documentation and Cleanup

    Documentation:
        Ensure each module and function is well-documented.
        Provide clear comments explaining complex parts of the code.

    Cleanup:
        Remove redundant or unused code.
        Optimize and refactor where necessary.
        Ensure the codebase adheres to the guiding principles.
